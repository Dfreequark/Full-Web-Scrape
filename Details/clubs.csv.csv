Road, Guwahati- 781003 Assam, India","The European Club of Gauhati was established in the winter of 1894 on the banks of the Brahmaputra, where the present judges’ bungalow stands – a “Europeans Only” meeting place from all walks of life. It was an oasis of exclusivity that resulted from their lack of interaction with the local community. The facilities then, included the games of Bridge, Billiards, Table Tennis, Lawn Tennis and Badminton. It even had three fishing boats for the use of its members. It was a place of fun and frolic."
